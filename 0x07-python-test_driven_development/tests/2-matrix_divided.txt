==================
1. Divide a matrix
==================

Import module:
=============

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

# Test Case 1: Regular case with integers

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
>>> div = 2
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
[[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0], [3.5, 4.0, 4.5]]

# Test Case 2: Regular case with floats

>>> matrix = [[1.5, 2.5, 3.5], [4.5, 5.5, 6.5], [7.5, 8.5, 9.5]]
>>> div = 1.5
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
[[1.0, 1.67, 2.33], [3.0, 3.67, 4.33], [5.0, 5.67, 6.33]]

# Test Case 3: Division by zero

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
>>> div = 0
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, div)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
division by zero

# Test Case 4: Matrix with different row sizes

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]
>>> div = 2
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, div)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Test Case 5: Matrix with non-numeric elements

>>> matrix = [[1, 'a', 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
>>> div = 2
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, div)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Test Case 6: Non-numeric divisor

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
>>> div = 'abc'
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, div)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
div must be a number
